# HandGesture_VolumeControl


In this project we have made HandGesture_VolumeControl..... So here we can control volumes in the system by hand...if we decrease the length between the fingers the volume will get decreased and if we increase the length the volume will be increased...not only in the program by default in the system also it changes...


we have used open cv and few other modules to do this project
